# Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Projects

This repository contains projects completed for the Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. The program covers topics such as Python programming, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, and transfer learning. Each project has its own subdirectory in this repository.

## Project 1: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

This is my first project in AI programming with Python Nanodegree program by Udacity. The goal of this project is to use a pre-trained convolutional neural network to identify whether an image is of a dog or not, and if it is, classify its breed.

## Project 2: Implement a Convolutional Neural Network with PyTorch

In this project, I built a Python application that can train an image classifier on a dataset, then use the trained model to predict new images. The project gave me hands-on experience with building and training deep learning models using the PyTorch library.

Both projects are part of the Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. The starter code for each project was provided by Udacity.
