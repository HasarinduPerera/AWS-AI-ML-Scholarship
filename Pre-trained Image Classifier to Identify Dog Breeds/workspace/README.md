# Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

This is my first project in AI programming with Python Nanodegree program by Udacity. The goal of this project is to use a pre-trained convolutional neural network to identify whether an image is of a dog or not, and if it is, classify its breed.

## Project Scope

The project has three main objectives:

1. Identify which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs.
2. Classify the breeds of dogs, for the images that are of dogs.
3. Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG16) "best" achieves the objectives 1 and 2.

## Project Results

After testing the three CNN model architectures, we found that the VGG16 model achieved the best results. It was able to classify "dogs" and "not-a-dog" with 100% accuracy, and had the best performance regarding breed classification with 100% accuracy.
